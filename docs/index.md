# FastAPI SOLID Docs: Building Scalable Python Web Apps

Welcome to the documentation for Fast API SOLID, a project that demonstrates how to implement the SOLID principles using FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python.

## Introduction

This project provides a sample implementation of a web application that follows SOLID principles, with clean architecture and dependency injection. It serves as an example of how to build scalable and maintainable web applications using modern Python tools and best practices.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, you'll need to have the following requirements installed on your computer:

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Pipenv

You can find more detailed instructions in the [requirements section of the README](./requirements).

## Usage

Once you have the requirements installed, you can clone the repository and run the project using the following steps:

1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the command `pipenv install` to install the required Python dependencies.
3. Run the command `docker-compose up -d` to build and run the Docker image.
4. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to view the project's homepage.

You can find more detailed instructions in the [running the project section of the README](./running-the-project).

## Documentation

You can find detailed documentation on how to use the API and other project features in the following sections:

- [Using Environment Variables](./using-environment-variables)
- [Database Migrations with Alembic](./database-migrations-with-alembic)
- [API Documentation](./api-documentation)
- [Testing](./testing)

## Contributing
